 * Disconnect message Class.
 * The DISCONNECT message is sent from the client to the server to indicate that it is about to close
 * its TCP/IP connection. This provides a clean disconnection, rather than just dropping the line.
 * If the client had connected with the clean session flag set,
 * then all previously maintained information about the client will be discarded.
 * A server should not rely on the client to close the TCP/IP connection after receiving a DISCONNECT.
